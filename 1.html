        <h4>What is coding?</h4>
        Coding, sometimes called <strong>computer programming</strong>, is how we communicate with computers.
        Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions.
        By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.
        You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.
